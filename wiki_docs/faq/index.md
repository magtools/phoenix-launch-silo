## How to configure Xdebug

**Configuring xdebug by Browser**

1) The first step is to install the [Browser Toolbar](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PhpStorm/Browser+Debugging+Extensions) and enable listening for PHP Debug Conections

![debug-toolbar](../img/debugtoolbar.png)

2) After that, the server name must be configured in Nginx.

To achieve this, please modify the nginx config file (file ended in .conf) setting the `server_name` attribute.

The file can be located running the command `warp info` in your root project folder with the "Nginx configuration file" flag

![nginx-config](../img/nginx-config.jpg)

3) Now is time to configure the Web Server in PHPStorm IDE

Please, go to: `File -> Settings->Languages & Frameworks -> PHP -> Servers`

Add a new Server clicking on the plus (+) button and set the following fields:

- `Name:` Must be the same name configured in Nginx `server_name` field
- `Host:` Must be the same value configured in Nginx `server_name` field
- `Port:` Should be 80 if you are using HTTP or 443 if you ar using HTTPS
- `Debbuger:` Choose Xdebug

After configure those values, check the option Use path mappings and configure the right paths. See the table below

|  File/Directory (Your computer - host)  |  absolute path on the Servers (inside the container)  |
|  ----------  |  ------------  |
| /path/to/current/project/     | /var/www/html/     |
| /path/to/current/project/pub/ | /var/www/html/pub/ |

4) Once that the Web Server has been configured, the PHP Web Aplication must be created, so go to Menu: `Run -> Edit Configurations`

Create a new PHP Web Application clicking on the plus (+) button and select the PHP Web Application option, then set the following fields:

- `Name:` Must be the same name configured in Nginx `server_name` field
- `Server:` Select the server created on previous step

![php_web_application](../img/php_web_application.png)

**Configuring xdebug by Console (cli)**

Using Xdebug by console requires to set **PHP_IDE_CONFIG** environment var with same Nginx server_name value.

Open the `.env` file located in your root project folder and set the value like this sample:

```bash
PHP_IDE_CONFIG=serverName=magento2.com
```

*Where magento2.com is the server_name set previously in Nginx configuration*

Configuring the Xdebug php extension (ext-xdebug.ini)

Plase located in your root project folder, execute the command: `warp php info`, you will see the location of `ext-xdebug.ini` file.

Open the file, for example located in `.warp/docker/config/php/ext-xdebug.ini`

Finally, make sure to configure your xdebug correctly, the most important options are:

- xdebug.remote_enable=1
- xdebug.remote_port=9000
- xdebug.remote_connect_back=0
- xdebug.idekey='PHPSTORM'
- xdebug.remote_host=172.17.0.1

The field `xdebug.remote_host` depends of your Operating System and your local configurations:
**Linux:** The IP should be grabbed from Docker network interface, ussually called `docker0`
You can get it running the command `ifconfig` for instance:

```bash
docker0: flags=4099  mtu 1500
    inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
    inet6 fe80::42:49ff:fec6:dfe7  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20
    ether 02:42:49:c6:df:e7  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
    RX packets 72049  bytes 4443463 (4.4 MB)
    RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
    TX packets 82000  bytes 435500419 (435.5 MB)
    TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

**Mac OS X:** The IP should be `xdebug.remote_host=10.254.254.254` added as an alias following the next steps:

1- Create the alias
```bash
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 10.254.254.254
```

2- Add the network configuration to OS X launch daemons, to create the alias automatically on system boot process.

```bash
sudo curl -o /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.summasolutions.docker_10254_alias.plist https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magtools/phoenix-launch-silo/refs/heads/master/release/landing/osx/net.summasolutions.docker_10254_alias.plist
```

## How to use Composer
```
warp composer install
```

## Setting up the Cron Jobs
**Editing The Crontab File**

- To check whether you have a crontab file run the following command:
```
warp crontab -l
```
- To create or edit a crontab file run the following command:
```
warp crontab -e
```

- The file that opens has a lot of information but the key part is the example just before the end of the comments section (comments are denoted by lines beginning with #).

```
# m h dom mon dow command
```
Example:

```
* * * * * www-data echo "Cron run test" >> /var/www/html/cron.log
```

!!! warning
    a blank line is required at the end of this file!

!!! note
    `warp start` refreshes the cron daemon inside the PHP container before leaving the project up.
    This is important on newer Debian-based images used from hosts such as Amazon Linux 2023,
    where the cron binary may exist outside the default `PATH` or an old daemon process may stay alive
    without processing `/etc/cron.d/cronfile`.
